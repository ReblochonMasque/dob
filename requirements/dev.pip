# FIXME/2018-06-13: (lb): Disable ipython, which requires PPT v1, and blocks v2.0.0.
#   Als, I'm not sure if the project actually uses ipython. I'm guessing the original
#   author uses ipython, and its inclusion here is just a convenience for them.
#   Also: I tried ipython==6.4.0, but that still requires PPT v1.
# Probably not needed:
#   ipython==4.2.0
watchdog==0.8.3
wheel==0.29.0
