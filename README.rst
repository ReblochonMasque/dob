Learn how dob works:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ dob demo

For more options, read the
`installation guide
<https://dob.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__.

**ALPHA ALERT!** |dob|_ is currently *alpha* software.
A proper, stable release is forthcoming this year!

* You can currently install and `demo dob`_.

* You could even start using |dob|_ today, but the developers are
  finishing a few features, and shoring up test coverage.

  And we would not want you to get frustrated, or to file bugs for issues
  we already plan to fix. So please be patient!

  (You may see progress by fits and starts, but it'll happen.)

=====
Ethos
=====

|dob|_ is a developer's tool, or at least targeted to someone whoâ€™s
comfortable in the terminal.

|dob|_ is perfect for the person who asks,
*Why must I use my mouse to manage time tracking?*

|dob|_ is inspired by
`Hamster <https://projecthamster.wordpress.com/>`__,
a beloved but aged time tracking application for
`GNOME <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME>`__.

Give |dob|_ a try, and you might like it.

- You can `Demo dob`_, `Import a legacy database`__, or `Start from scratch`__.

If you like |dob|_, hopefully you'll help us make it better!

========
Features
========

* Compatible with all current Python releases (3.5, 3.6, and 3.7).

* Naturally Unicode compatible -- spice up your notes!
* Can migrate legacy Hamster databases (and fix integrity issues, too).
* Excellent coverage (to give you comfort knowing your Facts are safe).
* Well documented features -- at runtime, or on the command line.
* Simple, elegant code base -- follows best practices, uses top libraries.
