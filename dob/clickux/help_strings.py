# Note that the help formatter reformats paragraphs when the help is
# displayed, to a width determined by the terminal and max_content_width.
# So the newlines you see in the text below will be removed and each
# paragraph will be reformatted with indents and new newlines inserted.
# - Your best bet to see how the text is formatted is to run the help.

# Note also that a lot of the help text is assembled at runtime, after
# dob has started and parsed command line arguments and configuration
# settings. This is because the global coloring() switch is off until
# after arguments are parsed and the config is read, and then it might
# be turned. But the way coloring works, ANSI is stripped when strings
# are assembled, as opposed to ANSI being stripped on output (the latter
# would make it easier to turn color on or off without having to rebuild
# strings, or to worry about when strings are generated; but our code is
# built the other way, so we have to wait for the coloring() question to
# be settled before building help text. Hence all the callbacks below.
#
# E.g., instead of seeing help text built like this:
#
#           SOME_HELP_TEXT = _("""Helps you.""")
#
#       you'll often see a builder method used instead, such as:

#           def SOME_HELP_TEXT(ctx):

        Commands for managing user configurable values.

        Some application behavior can be changed via config values.

        Config values can be persisted across invocation in a config
        file.

        You can also specify config values at runtime on the command line,
        or using environment variables.

        {underlined}Config File Location{reset}

        By default, {rawname} looks for a configuration file at:

            {default_config_path}

        - You can specify an alternative file location
        using the {codehi}{envkey}{reset} environment value.

          E.g., you could set the environment for just the command subshell like:

          \b
          {codehi}{envkey}=path/to/{rawname}.conf {rawname} COMMAND ...{reset}

          or you could export the environment variable first and then invoke {rawname}:

          \b
          {codehi}export {envkey}=path/to/{rawname}.conf{reset}
          {codehi}{rawname} COMMAND ...{reset}

        - You can alternatively specify the configuration file location
        using the {codehi}-C/--configfile{reset} global option, e.g.,
        using shorthand:

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} -C path/to/{rawname}.conf COMMAND ...{reset}

          or using --option=value longhand:

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} --configfile=path/to/{rawname}.conf COMMAND ...{reset}

        {underlined}Config Value Precedence{reset}

        - If no config value is specified for a setting, {rawname}
        uses a default value.

        - If a config value is found in the config value, that value
        takes precedence over the default value.

        - If a corresponding environment variable for the config value
        is found, that value is preferred over the value from the file.

          - The environment variable for each setting is formed from
        a prefix, {codehi}DOB_CONFIG_{reset}, followed by the uppercase
        section name and the uppercase setting name.

          E.g., here's how to specify the db_engine setting using its
        environment variable:

          \b
          {codehi}DOB_CONFIG_BACKEND_DB_ENGINE=sqlite {rawname} stats{reset}

        - If a config value is specified via the command line, that value is
        preferred over all other values.

          - You can specify config values using the {codehi}-c/--config{reset}
        option, e.g.,

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} -c backend.db_engine=sqlite stats{reset}

        {underlined}Config Command Overview{reset}

          - You can edit the config file directly, or (better yet) you can
        use the {codehi}dob set{reset} command to change its values.
        E.g., to enable coloring whenever you use {rawname}, run:

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} config set client term_color True{reset}

          or omit the section name (because {rawname} is smart) and run instead:

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} config set term_color True{reset}

          - If you remove the config file, or if you delete values from it,
        don't worry, {rawname} will use default values instead.

          - You can recreate the config file (and overwrite the existing file)
        with defaults by:

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} config create --force{reset}

          - The best way to learn about all configurable settings is to
        print the config table, which includes a helpful message for each
        option:

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} config dump{reset}

          - If you think your config file is missing values, you can
        update it with missing settings by running (naturally) the
        update command:

          \b
          {codehi}{rawname} config update{reset}

            - But you should not care about the contents of the config file
        if you stick to using {codehi}{rawname} config dump{reset} and
        {codehi}{rawname} config set{reset} commands.

            - Although you might care about the config file contents if you'd
        like to add comments to it, which is supported.

    {time_range_info}
    \b
    About time range formats:
    You may omit any date and/or time portion of that format, in which case we
    will complete the missing information as described further down.
    Alternatively you can just pass start time offset from now in minutes such
    as ' -XX' (where X are 'minutes before now) which will also apply our
    'completion strategy' to the end time related values. Please note that you
    if you specify a relative starting time you need to wrap it in quotation
    marks as well as lead with a whitespace in front of the '-' sign.

    \b
    How missing date/time information is completed:
        * Missing *start date* will fall back to 'today'.
#FIXME: (lb): day_start is disabled by default (I never liked this weird legacy behavior)
# new workflow is to start 'now', eh?
#        * Missing *start time* will fall back to your configured 'day_start'
#          setting.
#        * Missing *end date* will be the day after today if 'day_start' is not
#          '00:00', else it will be today.
#        * Missing *end time* will be one second before your configured
#          'day_start' value.

#        If always an '@' you could know if activity specified,

#        OR: You could require that an Activity be specified!
#          (And you don't need category if it can be inferred; or if you
#           use a default.)
#          (You could say that you could have an Activity default, but I
#          don't want to encourage not categorizing your Facts, so require
#          an Activity -- if anything, a lazy user could either make a Bash
#          alias, or make a catch-all Activity, e.g.,
#           `hamster at now null I did something.`
#
#        For #tags, you could require that if multiple words, they're wrapped

#        Otherwise, if just single words, then you don't need that silly comma

    \b
    FACTOID:

    \b
    Describes the Fact being created, including the start time, the
    Activity, and maybe Category, any tags, and the fact description.

    \b
    The FACTOID has the following format:

    \b
    [<timestamp>] [<activity>[@<category>]] [<tags>] <description>

     \b
     <timestamp>
     An optional timestamp, or "now" if not specified.

     \b
     The timestamp may be in hour and minutes (for the present day);

      \b
      or it may also include the year, month, and day;

      \b
      or it may specify a human-readable, friendly time,
       such as "now", "yesterday", "2 hours ago", etc.

     \b
     The timestamp must match one of the following formats:

     \b
     'HH:MM'             Clock time of present day, in 24 H military time.
     'HH:MM (AM|PM)'     Clock time of present day, in 12 H civilian time.
     '-MM'               Minutes before now; useful when Fact just started.
     'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [AM|PM]'
                         Year, month, day, and clock time.
     <friendly-time>     "1 week ago", "45 mins ago", "yesterday @ 3 PM", etc.

    \b
    <activity>
    The name of the Activity with which to associate the Fact.
    This value is mandatory.

    \b
    <category>
    The Category associated with the Activity. If not specified, the
    first Category found (searching alphabetically) that contains the
    Activity will be used, or the last Category specified.

     \b
     HINT: Each Category contains one or more Activities, and each
     Activity belongs to one or more Categories, but each Activity
     will only be associated with any one Category at most once.

    \b
    <tags>
    Tags to apply to the Fact. These are optional.

     Each tag is usually delimited by an @ symbol, rather than a #,
     because Bash and other shells interpret an octothorpe as the
     start of a comment. However, you can use a # symbol if you use
     quotes around it, or if you escape the # symbol (e.g., '\#').

     E.g., these are all acceptable tags:

      @tag1 @"tag2 too" "#tag3" @give-it-up-for-tag4 \#tag5 '#'tag6

     \b
     HINT: Use quotes if a tag contains whitespace, e.g., <@foo-bar>,
     <"@foo bar">, and <@"foo bar"> are all acceptable, but <@foo bar>
     would be interpreted as the tag "foo", and the description, "bar".

    \b
    <description>
    A description of the Fact for the particular Activity being performed
    at the indicated time. Which is to say, journal away! This is your
    worklog entry, or your diary entry, or whatever it is you want to
    call it. Record what you're doing, or what you're feeling, dig it?

    \b
    EXAMPLES:

     \b
     # Start your day by starting a Fact under the "Waking up" Activity
     # in the "Personal" category:

     \b
     hamster at 08:00 Waking up@Personal Woke up. Slept pretty well, \\
     except for the spiders again.

     \b
     # Get ready for work, and then use the 'to' command and an empty '@'
     # symbol to indicate the same Activity being closed.

     \b
     hamster to 08:45 @ Getting ready for work.

     \b
     # Commute to work and then fill in the missing gap in hamster.
     # Use a tag to remember what mode you used to travel.
