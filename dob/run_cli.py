    #
    # By default, Click processes help immediately when spotted.
    #
    # This has a few consequences:
    #
    # - If --help is seen before the subcommand in args, the run() method
    #   below is not called, because Click handles the --help before invoking
    #   the callback, and the Click help callback prints the help and exits.
    #   As such, color and paging will not be setup properly for root help.
    #   However, for subcommand help, our run() will be called, and then color
    #   and paging will be setup properly for the subcommand help!
    #
    # - If the user wants help on a subcommand, Click forces them to specify
    #   the --help option after the command, i.e., `dob --help command` would
    #   normally print the same thing as `dob --help`. But we'd rather print
    #   the help for the subcommand specified. (This also makes such obvious
    #   commands like `dob help command` work as expected as well!)
